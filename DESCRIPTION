Description: An implementation of an all-in-one function for a wide range
    of meta-analysis problems. It contains three functions. The gmeta() function
    unifies all standard meta-analysis methods and also several newly developed ones
    under a framework of combining confidence distributions (CDs). Specifically,
    the package can perform classical p-value combination methods (such as methods
    of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-analysis fixed-effect and random-
    effects models, and synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore, it can perform robust
    meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-misspecifications, and
    limits the impact of any unknown outlying studies. In addition, the package
    implements two exact meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with
    rare events (e.g., zero total event). The np.gmeta() function summarizes
    information obtained from multiple studies and makes inference for study-level
    parameters with no distributional assumption. Specifically, it can construct
    confidence intervals for unknown, fixed study-level parameters via confidence
    distribtuion. Furthermore, it can perform estimation via asymptotic confidence
    distribution whether tie or near tie condition exist or not. The plot.gmeta()
    function to visualize individual and combined CDs through extended forest plots
    is also available. Compared to version 2.2-6, version 2.3-0 contains a new function np.gmeta().
